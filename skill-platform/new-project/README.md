# SkillMeasure Starter

Minimal Node + Express starter that serves a static frontend and a simple API.

Quick start

```bash
cd skill-platform/new-project
npm install
npm start
```

- Server: http://localhost:3000
- API: GET /api/ping

You can run `npm run dev` if you install `nodemon` globally for hot reload during development.
